Week 2: Implementing Authentication and Authorization Endpoints
3. Task: Implement user registration endpoint.

    Subtasks:
        Create a route for user registration.
        Implement validation using Pydantic models.
        Hash user passwords securely before storing.

    Task: Implement login endpoint with JWT token generation.
        Subtasks:
            Create a route for user login.
            Validate user credentials.
